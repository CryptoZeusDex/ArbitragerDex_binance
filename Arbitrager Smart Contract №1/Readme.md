This "DexPrice" smart contract serves as an interface for two ERC20 tokens, "tokenA" and "tokenB", and three decentralized exchanges (DEXs), "dex1", "dex2", and "dex3". The contract includes functions for updating the prices of the two tokens on the three DEXs, checking for arbitrage opportunities, calculating the price difference between the DEXs, and executing arbitrage transactions. Additionally, the contract includes functions for transferring and approving tokens, setting the gas price, and retrieving information such as the fees and gas price. The contract is licensed under the MIT License and requires Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher.

The "updatePrices()" function updates the token prices on the DEXs by using the token balances and the total supply of each token on each DEX. The "checkArbitrage()" function checks for arbitrage opportunities between the DEXs based on the current token prices. The "getDifference()" function calculates the price difference between the DEXs and takes into account the fees of each DEX to determine whether an arbitrage opportunity exists.

The "arbitrage()" function executes an arbitrage transaction consisting of three trades on the DEXs using the balances of "tokenA" and "tokenB" and "WBNB" (Wrapped Binance Coin), which is typically used as an intermediary token on the Binance Smart Chain.

The "transferToken()", "approveToken()", and "transferFromToken()" functions allow the contract to transfer, approve, and transfer tokens, respectively, while the "setGasPrice()" function sets the gas price for transactions.

In general, to use the contract, after deploying it on the Binance Smart Chain, the user must call the "updatePrices()" function to update the token prices on the three DEXs. The user can then call the "checkArbitrage()" function to check for arbitrage opportunities. If an arbitrage opportunity exists, the user can call the "arbitrage()" function to execute an arbitrage transaction. After the transaction is executed, the contract automatically transfers the profits to the user's balance.
